```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Expected Behavior</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This displays as expected without visual conflicts.</p>
</div>
```
In the solution, we've ensured that the classes work together harmoniously, producing the intended visual effect.  Reviewing class application and using browser developer tools to inspect rendered styles is key to debugging such issues.
