```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Unexpected Behavior</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">Some text here.</p>
</div>
```

This code might produce unexpected visual results due to conflicting or wrongly used Tailwind CSS classes.  The `shadow-md` class, for instance, might overlap with other styles causing unintended effects.
