# Tailwind CSS Styling Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected visual results stemming from conflicting or improperly used utility classes. 

The `bug.html` file showcases a simple example where the `shadow-md` class interacts unexpectedly with other styles resulting in a layout that differs from expectations.

The `solution.html` file provides a corrected version, illustrating how to avoid such conflicts by carefully selecting and combining classes, or using more specific styling to override any unintended overlaps.
